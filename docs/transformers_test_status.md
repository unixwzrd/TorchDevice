This document tracks the status of Hugging Face Transformers test suites when run with TorchDevice integration.Utils - Modeling Utilities (Offline model loading)

---

### `tests/utils/test_versions_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED (2 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Dependency Version Checks
- **Notes:**
  - TorchDevice was confirmed active via `tests/__init__.py` (explicit print message "TorchDevice activated..." observed).
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs were observed during initial environment/library loading phases.
  - The `test_versions_utils.py` tests themselves are CPU-bound and did not trigger further TorchDevice redirections.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_versions_utils`

---

### `tests/utils/test_tokenization_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED (15 tests), SKIPPED (6 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Tokenization Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - TorchDevice was confirmed active via `tests/__init__.py` (explicit print message "TorchDevice activated..." observed).
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs were observed during initial environment/library loading phases, but not during the execution of the tokenization tests themselves. This suggests these specific tests are primarily CPU-bound and did not make direct device calls that TorchDevice would need to intercept.
  - 6 tests related to `TokenizerPushToHubTester` were skipped with the reason 'test is staging test'.
  - A `FutureWarning` regarding `AlbertTokenizer.from_pretrained()` and a non-critical `Trie` algorithm bug message ("Attempting to recover") were observed; these appear unrelated to TorchDevice functionality.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_tokenization_utils`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_model_output.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED (15 tests), SKIPPED (6 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Tokenization Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - TorchDevice was confirmed active via `tests/__init__.py` (explicit print message "TorchDevice activated..." observed).
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs were observed during initial environment/library loading phases, but not during the execution of the tokenization tests themselves. This suggests these specific tests are primarily CPU-bound and did not make direct device calls that TorchDevice would need to intercept.
  - 6 tests related to `TokenizerPushToHubTester` were skipped with the reason 'test is staging test'.
  - A `FutureWarning` regarding `AlbertTokenizer.from_pretrained()` and a non-critical `Trie` algorithm bug message ("Attempting to recover") were observed; these appear unrelated to TorchDevice functionality.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_tokenization_utils`

---

### `tests/utils/test_modeling_utils.py` (Specific: `TestOffline.test_offline`)

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Modeling Utilities (Offline model loading)
- **Notes:**
  - The specific test `TestOffline.test_offline` which previously caused a "Bus Error" now PASSES.
  - TorchDevice was active via the centralized import in `tests/__init__.py` (triggered by `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1`).
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs confirmed TorchDevice activity.
  - This resolves a critical crash encountered in earlier testing phases.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_modeling_utils.TestOffline.test_offline`

---

### `tests/utils/test_offline.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED (1 SKIPPED)
- **Component:** Utils - Offline Mode Functionality
- **Notes:**
  - 5 out of 6 tests passed. 1 test was skipped (reason for skip not investigated further as per user direction).
  - TorchDevice was active via `tests/__init__.py` and "GPU REDIRECT" logs were observed.
  - No bus errors or crashes encountered.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_offline`

---

### `tests/utils/test_processing_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Processing Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All 2 tests in this suite passed.
  - TorchDevice was active via `tests/__init__.py` and "GPU REDIRECT" logs were observed.
  - A warning regarding `images` and `text` input order was observed, but this is standard behavior for the transformers library and unrelated to TorchDevice.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_processing_utils`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_model_output.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED (1 test), SKIPPED (1 test), PASSED (11 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - ModelOutput Class
- **Notes:**
  - `test_torch_pytree` FAILED due to an `AssertionError` in `pytree.treespec_dumps(actual_tree_spec)`. The expected string in the test (`"context": ["a", "c"]`) does not match the actual output (`"context": ["a", "c"]`). This is likely an artifact of the test execution environment (`TD_tests` vs. `tests`) affecting the module path in the type serialization string. Attempts to correct the expected string in the test file have been unsuccessful so far.
  - `test_export_serialization` was SKIPPED due to "CPU OOM".
  - The remaining 11 tests passed.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active, patching PyTorch operations. The failure is related to test environment string differences, not TorchDevice functionality.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_model_output.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_flax_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** SKIPPED (17 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Flax Modeling Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All 17 tests were skipped. These tests are specific to Flax/JAX utilities and are not relevant to the PyTorch-focused TorchDevice integration.
  - Tests were likely skipped due to unmet Flax/JAX dependencies or decorators like `@require_flax`.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active but had no interaction with the test execution logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_flax_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_rope_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (10 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All 10 tests passed.
  - These tests verify the numerical correctness and behavior of various RoPE implementations (Linear Scaling, Dynamic NTK, YaRN).
  - TorchDevice was imported and active. GPU redirections (e.g., `tensor.to(device='cuda')` to `mps`) were observed in the logs.
  - The tests involve PyTorch tensor operations and device handling, and they passed successfully with TorchDevice.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_rope_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_tf_core.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** SKIPPED (0 tests run)
- **Component:** Utils - TensorFlow Core Modeling Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All tests were skipped (0 tests executed). These are TensorFlow-specific core modeling utility tests.
  - They are not expected to run in the current PyTorch-centric test environment, likely due to `is_tf_available()` checks or similar conditions.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active but had no interaction with the test execution logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_tf_core.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_tf_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** SKIPPED (26 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - TensorFlow Modeling Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All 26 tests were skipped. These are TensorFlow-specific modeling utility tests.
  - They are not expected to run in the current PyTorch-centric test environment, likely due to `is_tf_available()` checks or similar conditions.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active but had no interaction with the test execution logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_tf_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** CRITICAL_FAILURE (Bus error: 10)
- **Component:** Utils - General Modeling Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - The test method `TestOffline.test_offline` crashes with a "Bus error: 10".
  - Logs consistently point to operations within `safetensors/torch.py` (e.g., `_flatten`, `_tobytes`, `tensor_to_replacement`) when handling `torch.float32` tensors on the `mps` device.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active, and GPU redirections were observed.
  - A "leaked semaphore objects" warning was also present at shutdown, suggesting potential issues with synchronization primitives.
  - This bus error is likely due to misaligned memory access or an attempt to access invalid memory regions during tensor manipulation on MPS, possibly exacerbated by `safetensors` interaction.
- **Test run command (for the specific failing test):** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_modeling_utils.py TestOffline.test_offline`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (5 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Model Card
- **Notes:**
  - All tests for `ModelCard` and `TrainingSummary` functionality passed. These tests cover dictionary conversion, JSON serialization/deserialization, file saving/loading (`to_json_file`, `from_json_file`, `save_pretrained`, `from_pretrained`), and basic metadata creation.
  - A `FutureWarning` from Transformers about the `ModelCard` class being deprecated was observed.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active but had no impact on these tests as they do not involve PyTorch tensor operations or device interactions.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_model_card.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_import_structure.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (1 test), SKIPPED (2 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Import Structure Validation
- **Notes:**
  - The `test_transformers_specific_model_import` test passed. This test verifies consistency between `__all__` definitions in model module files and the objects registered via Transformers' internal import structure mechanism.
  - `test_definition` and `test_export_backend_should_be_defined` were skipped as they are marked with `@unittest.skip` in the test file.
  - TorchDevice was imported and performed its standard patching, but the tests themselves focus on static code structure and file parsing, not PyTorch runtime operations, so no direct interaction was expected or observed.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_import_structure.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_image_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (3 tests), SKIPPED (5 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Image Processing, Hub Interaction
- **Notes:**
  - `ImageProcessorUtilTester.test_cached_files_are_used_when_internet_is_down`, `ImageProcessorUtilTester.test_image_processor_from_pretrained_subfolder`, and `ImageProcessingUtilsTester.test_get_size_dict` passed. These tests cover caching, loading from subfolders, and dictionary utilities, none of which are expected to be directly affected by TorchDevice's GPU redirection.
  - All 5 tests in `ImageProcessorPushToHubTester` were skipped, likely due to the `@is_staging_test` decorator and unmet environment conditions for Hub interaction tests.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active, performing standard import-time patching.
  - Standard Transformers library warnings about `CLIPFeatureExtractor` deprecation and `use_fast` behavior were observed.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_image_processing_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_hub_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07

- **Component:** Utils - Hub Utilities (`cached_file`, `has_file`)
- **Notes:**
  - All 9 tests in `GetFromCacheTests` passed.
  - TorchDevice was imported and performed its standard extensive patching at import time.
  - The tests focus on Hugging Face Hub interactions (caching, file resolution, error handling for gated/missing repositories) and do not involve PyTorch operations that would be affected by TorchDevice's core redirection logic.
  - A `ResourceWarning` for an unclosed file was observed in `test_get_file_from_repo_distant`, originating from the test or the utility it calls, unrelated to TorchDevice.
  - Expected `EnvironmentError` for gated repo access without authentication was correctly handled by the tests.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_hub_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_feature_extraction_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (1 test), SKIPPED (5 tests)
- **Component:** Utils - Feature Extraction, Hub Interaction
- **Notes:**
  - `FeatureExtractorUtilTester.test_cached_files_are_used_when_internet_is_down` passed. This test focuses on caching behavior with mocked network requests and is not expected to be affected by TorchDevice.
  - All 5 tests in `FeatureExtractorPushToHubTester` were skipped. These tests are decorated with `@is_staging_test` and likely require specific environment variables (e.g., `RUN_STAGING_TESTS`, `TOKEN`) to run, which were not met.
  - TorchDevice was imported and active, performing its usual import-time patching.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_feature_extraction_utils.py`

---

- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_expectations.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_dynamic_module_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Dynamic Module Utilities (`get_imports`)
- **Notes:**
  - All 10 parameterized tests passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was imported. The tests focus on static code analysis (parsing import statements from Python code snippets) and do not involve PyTorch runtime operations that would be affected by TorchDevice's core redirection logic.
  - Unrelated warnings observed: Pydantic `Field` deprecation, and `FutureWarning`s for deprecated `_StreamBase`/`_EventBase` in TorchDevice's own stream/event handling code.
- **Test run command:** `python -m pytest TD_tests/utils/test_dynamic_module_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_convert_slow_tokenizer.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Tokenizer Conversion (transformers.convert_slow_tokenizer.SpmConverter)
- **Notes:**
  - The single test `test_spm_converter_bytefallback_warning` passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was imported and initialized. Logs indicate it patched components from other libraries in the environment (e.g., `torchao`, `peft`).
  - The test itself focuses on warning mechanisms within `SpmConverter` related to SentencePiece model properties and does not involve runtime PyTorch operations that would be affected by TorchDevice's core redirection logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_convert_slow_tokenizer.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_cli.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Command Line Interface (transformers-cli)
- **Notes:**
  - All 3 tests (`test_cli_env`, `test_cli_download`, `test_cli_download_trust_remote`) passed successfully.

- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_cli.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_chat_template_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Chat Template Utilities (transformers.utils.get_json_schema)
- **Notes:**
  - All 20 tests passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was imported and initialized, but these tests focus on parsing Python function signatures and docstrings to generate JSON schemas. They do not involve runtime PyTorch tensor operations or model execution, so TorchDevice had no direct interaction with the test logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_chat_template_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_backbone_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (3 passed, 4 skipped)
- **Component:** Utils - Backbone Utilities (transformers.utils.backbone_utils)
- **Notes:**
  - 3 out of 7 tests passed, 4 were skipped. No failures.
  - TorchDevice was active during the tests.
  - Key test `test_load_backbone_in_new_model` (involving model instantiation and backbone loading) passed successfully.
  - Skipped tests are likely due to test-specific configurations or decorators (e.g., `@slow`).
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_backbone_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_audio_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Utils - Audio Utilities (transformers.audio_utils)
- **Notes:**
  - All 25 tests passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was active during the tests. The audio utility functions likely operate on NumPy arrays or use PyTorch tensor operations in a way that is compatible with TorchDevice's current patching.
  - A `UserWarning` regarding mel filter configuration was observed from the `transformers` library itself, not indicative of a TorchDevice issue.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_audio_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_add_new_model_like.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** SKIPPED
- **Component:** Utils - Add New Model Like (transformers.commands.add_new_model_like)
- **Notes:**
  - All 22 tests were skipped. The `TestAddNewModelLike` class is decorated with `@require_torch`, `@require_tf`, and `@require_flax`.
  - This indicates that one or more of these frameworks (likely TensorFlow and/or Flax) are not available or not configured in the current test environment, leading to the tests being skipped.
  - TorchDevice was imported but had no interaction with these tests as they did not execute their core logic.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_add_new_model_like.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_activations_tf.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** SKIPPED
- **Component:** TensorFlow Activations
- **Notes:**
  - All 2 tests were skipped. The `TestTFActivations` class is decorated with `@require_tf`.
  - This indicates TensorFlow is likely not available or not configured in the current test environment, leading to the tests being skipped as per the decorator's design.
  - TorchDevice was imported but, as expected, had no interaction with these TensorFlow-specific tests.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_activations_tf.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_hf_argparser.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Argument Parsing Utilities (`HfArgumentParser`, `TrainingArguments`)
- **Notes:**
  - All 16 tests in `HfArgumentParserTest` passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was active, confirmed by "GPU REDIRECT" logs.
  - No interference observed with argument parsing logic, including tests involving `TrainingArguments` and `@require_torch`.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_hf_argparser.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_logging.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Component:** Logging Utilities
- **Notes:**
  - All 5 tests in the `HfArgumentParserTest` class passed successfully.
  - TorchDevice was active, confirmed by "GPU REDIRECT" logs, and did not interfere with the logging tests.
  - Test output, including captured log messages and warnings, was as expected.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_logging.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_configuration_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (some SKIPPED)
- **Component:** Configuration Utilities / Hub Interaction
- **Notes:**
  - The test suite ran 15 tests, with 10 passing and 5 skipped. The skipped tests are part of the `ConfigPushToHubTester` class, likely due to the `@is_staging_test` decorator, which is expected behavior in a standard test environment.
  - TorchDevice was active, confirmed by "GPU REDIRECT" logs. Its impact on these configuration-focused tests is minimal, and no issues were introduced.
  - A `ResourceWarning` for an unclosed file was observed, but this appears to be a pre-existing characteristic of the test `test_local_versioning`.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_configuration_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_skip_decorators.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED (SKIPPED)
- **Component:** Test Decorators / Environment Flags
- **Notes:**
  - All 3 tests in the `SkipTester` class were skipped, which is the expected behavior as they are decorated with `@slow` and the `RUN_SLOW` environment variable is not set to `1`.
  - TorchDevice was active, and its primary influence here would be on the `@require_torch_gpu` decorator (by making `torch.cuda.is_available()` appear true for MPS). The skipping logic based on `@slow` correctly took precedence.
  - The test suite behaves as expected in the current testing environment when TorchDevice is active.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_skip_decorators.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_import_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** INDETERMINATE / NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- **Component:** Import Utilities / Subprocess Testing
- **Notes:**
  - The test `test_clear_import_cache` is decorated with `@run_test_using_subprocess`, meaning its core logic executes in an isolated subprocess.
  - The main `unittest` process reported "Ran 0 tests ... OK". This often indicates the subprocess execution isn't counted as a 'run' test by the parent runner.
  - While "GPU REDIRECT" logs from TorchDevice were observed in the parent process, it's uncertain if TorchDevice patches were active and influential within the separate subprocess where the test's assertions execute.
  - Further investigation would be needed to confirm TorchDevice's behavior within the subprocess context for this test.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_import_utils.py`

---

### `TD_tests/utils/test_activations.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Notes:**
  - All 4 tests passed.
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs observed, indicating TorchDevice was active and redirecting tensor operations to MPS.
  - This suite tests various activation functions, which appear to be compatible with TorchDevice's MPS redirection.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_activations.py`

---

- **Status:** PASSED
- **Notes:**
  - All run tests passed (109 run, 33 skipped).
  - "GPU REDIRECT" logs observed, indicating TorchDevice was active.
  - This suite tests fast tokenizer functionalities, which appear to be compatible with TorchDevice and do not trigger the DeBERTa JIT import issue.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/tokenization/test_tokenization_fast.py`

---

### `TD_tests/models/bert/test_modeling_bert.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Notes:**
  - All tests passed. Many were skipped (as is normal for this suite depending on environment).
  - No "GPU REDIRECT" logs from TorchDevice observed, suggesting PyTorch's native MPS support handled calls, or tests didn't trigger relevant CUDA paths patched by TorchDevice.
  - Test run command: `python -m unittest TD_tests/models/bert/test_modeling_bert.py`

## Failing Tests (Known Issues)

### `TD_tests/utils/test_cache_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED (1 failed, 3 passed, 20 skipped)
- **Component:** Utils - Cache Utilities (transformers.cache_utils, torch.export)
- **Test:** `test_dynamic_cache_exportability`
- **Issue:** `AssertionError: mps` during `torch.export.export()`. The `torch.export` process, when creating `FakeTensor` objects, expects tensors to be on the "meta" device but encountered an "mps" tensor due to TorchDevice redirection.
- **Error Log Snippet:**

  ```text
  File "/Users/unixwzrd/miniconda3/envs/LLaSA-speech/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/_subclasses/fake_tensor.py", line 716, in __new__
    assert elem.device.type == "meta", elem.device.type

  AssertionError: mps
  ```

- **Notes:**
  - TorchDevice was active.
  - 20 tests were skipped, likely due to unmet GPU requirements or other decorators.
  - This indicates a direct incompatibility between TorchDevice's MPS redirection and `torch.export`'s internal mechanisms.
- **TorchDevice Components Involved:**
  - `core.device.DeviceManager` (device redirection)
  - Potentially tensor subclassing/patching if `torch.export` interacts with tensor types directly.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_cache_utils.py`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_file_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED (KNOWN ISSUE - DeBERTa JIT)
- **Component:** File Utilities / Broad Imports / JIT Compilation
- **Error Snippet:**

  ```text
  RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta because of the following error (look up to see its traceback):
  TypeError: module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object was expected, got builtin_function_or_method

  ```

- **Notes:**
  - The test fails due to the wildcard import `from transformers import *`, which attempts to import and JIT-compile all models, including DeBERTa.
  - DeBERTa's JIT compilation triggers a known TorchDevice incompatibility with `inspect.getfile` when used within `torch.jit.script`.
  - The actual tests within `test_file_utils.py` (related to import mechanisms and context managers) are not the direct cause but are unrunnable due to the import-time failure.
  - TorchDevice was active, confirmed by "GPU REDIRECT" logs preceding the error.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_file_utils.py`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_generic.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED (1 failure, 5 errors, 11 skipped)
- **Component:** Data Type Conversion / Dynamo
- **Errors & Failures:**
    1. **`TypeError: Cannot convert a MPS Tensor to float64 dtype as the MPS framework doesn't support float64. Please use float32 instead.`**
        - Occurred in: `test_reshape_torch`, `test_squeeze_torch`, `test_transpose_torch`.
        - **Suspected Cause:** These tests likely create `np.float64` arrays (default for `np.random.randn`) and then attempt to convert them to `torch.tensor()`. When TorchDevice redirects to MPS, the conversion to `float64` MPS tensors fails as MPS does not support this dtype.
        - **Next Steps:** TorchDevice could consider automatically downcasting `float64` numpy arrays to `float32` when creating MPS tensors, possibly with a warning.
    2. **`AssertionError: mps` (in `test_decorator_torch_export`)**
        - Occurred during `torch.export.export(model, args=(torch.tensor(10),))`. The traceback shows `assert elem.device.type == \"meta\", elem.device.type` failing because `elem.device.type` was `mps`.
        - **Suspected Cause:** `torch.export`'s `FakeTensor` mechanism expects tensors to be on a "meta" device during its tracing/export process. TorchDevice's redirection to MPS conflicts with this expectation.
        - **Next Steps:** Investigate how TorchDevice's MPS redirection interacts with `torch.export` and its `FakeTensor` internals. It might require specific handling or patching for `torch.export` contexts.
- **Diagnostic Info:** The `torch.compile` tests within `test_generic.py` (`test_decorator_compiled`) passed, unlike the `_cuda_getDevice` error seen in `test_deprecation.py`. This suggests the `_cuda_getDevice` issue might be specific to how `get_rng_state` is called or handled within `torch.compile` contexts.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_generic.py`

### `TD_tests/models/bart/test_modeling_bart.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Component:** JIT Compilation / inspect.getfile
- **Error:** JIT Compilation Error with DeBERTa import.

  ```text

  TypeError: module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object was expected, got builtin_function_or_method
  ...
  RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta because of the following error...

  ```

- **Cause:** The error occurs during the JIT scripting (`@torch.jit.script`) of components within `transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta`. Python's `inspect.getfile()` (potentially via `torch.package.package_importer._patched_getfile`) fails. This is likely due to an interaction with TorchDevice's patching mechanisms altering how objects are presented or handled during the JIT process.
- **Diagnostic Info:**
  - Reproduced with minimal script: `test_jit_deberta.py`.
  - Traceback points to `inspect.getfile()` and `torch.package.package_importer._patched_getfile`.
- **Potential `TorchDevice` Area:** JIT/Compiler Support, Import/Patching Mechanisms.
- **Next Steps:** Deferred. Requires deeper investigation into TorchDevice's interaction with PyTorch JIT.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/models/bart/test_modeling_bart.py`

### `TD_tests/models/gpt2/test_modeling_gpt2.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Component:** JIT Compilation / inspect.getfile
- **Error:** Same JIT Compilation Error with DeBERTa import as `test_modeling_bart.py`.

  ```text

  TypeError: module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object was expected, got builtin_function_or_method
  ...
  RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta because of the following error...

  ```

- **Cause:** The error occurs during the JIT scripting (`@torch.jit.script`) of components within `transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta`, triggered by shared components in the test framework. Python's `inspect.getfile()` (potentially via `torch.package.package_importer._patched_getfile`) fails. This is likely due to an interaction with TorchDevice's patching mechanisms.
- **Diagnostic Info:**
  - Same traceback signature as `test_modeling_bart.py` and `test_jit_deberta.py`.
- **Potential `TorchDevice` Area:** JIT/Compiler Support, Import/Patching Mechanisms.
- **Next Steps:** Deferred. Requires deeper investigation into TorchDevice's interaction with PyTorch JIT.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/models/gpt2/test_modeling_gpt2.py`

---

### `TD_tests/models/distilbert/test_modeling_distilbert.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Component:** JIT Compilation / inspect.getfile
- **Error:** Same JIT Compilation Error with DeBERTa import as `test_modeling_bart.py` and `test_modeling_gpt2.py`.

  ```text

  TypeError: module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object was expected, got builtin_function_or_method
  ...
  RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta because of the following error...

  ```

- **Cause:** The error occurs during the JIT scripting (`@torch.jit.script`) of components within `transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta`, triggered by shared components in the test framework (likely `auto_factory.py` during model discovery). Python's `inspect.getfile()` (potentially via `torch.package.package_importer._patched_getfile`) fails. This is likely due to an interaction with TorchDevice's patching mechanisms.
- **Diagnostic Info:**
  - Same traceback signature as `test_modeling_bart.py`, `test_modeling_gpt2.py`, and `test_jit_deberta.py`.
  - Traceback indicates failure path through `transformers.models.auto.auto_factory.py`.
- **Potential `TorchDevice` Area:** JIT/Compiler Support, Import/Patching Mechanisms.
- **Next Steps:** Deferred. Requires deeper investigation into TorchDevice's interaction with PyTorch JIT.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/models/distilbert/test_modeling_distilbert.py`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_generic.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** FAILED (1 failure, 5 errors, 11 skipped)
- **Component:** Utils - Generic Utilities (involving `torch.export` / `FakeTensor`)
- **Error:**

  ```text

  AssertionError: mps
  ...
    File "/Users/unixwzrd/miniconda3/envs/LLaSA-speech/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/_subclasses/fake_tensor.py", line 716, in **new**
      assert elem.device.type == "meta", elem.device.type

  ```

- **Suspected Cause / Notes:**
  - The failure is due to an `AssertionError: mps` within PyTorch's `FakeTensor` subsystem.
  - This occurs when a tracing mechanism (likely `torch.export` or similar, used in tests like `test_torch_save_load_from_different_process`) expects tensors to be on the "meta" device for shape/type propagation, but encounters a tensor on the "mps" device due to TorchDevice's redirection.
  - This is a different root cause than previously noted for this file.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_generic`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_cache_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** FAILED (1 failure, 20 skipped) - REGRESSION
- **Component:** Utils - Cache Utilities (involving `torch.export` / `FakeTensor`)
- **Error:**

  ```text

  AssertionError: mps
  ...
    File "/Users/unixwzrd/miniconda3/envs/LLaSA-speech/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/_subclasses/fake_tensor.py", line 716, in **new**
      assert elem.device.type == "meta", elem.device.type

  ```

- **Suspected Cause / Notes:**
  - REGRESSION: This test previously passed.
  - The failure is due to an `AssertionError: mps` within PyTorch's `FakeTensor` subsystem, identical to the issue in `test_generic.py`.
  - TorchDevice's redirection to MPS causes a tensor to be on the `mps` device when `torch.export` or a related mechanism (used by cache utilities, possibly for serialization or model representation) expects a `meta` device tensor.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_cache_utils`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_deprecation.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-07
- **Status:** FAILED (1 error)
- **Component:** torch.compile / CUDA Internals (_cuda_getDevice) /RNG
- **Error:** `torch._dynamo.exc.InternalTorchDynamoError: AttributeError: module 'torch._C' has no attribute '_cuda_getDevice'`
- **Suspected Cause:** The error occurs in the `test_compile_safe` method, which uses `torch.compile`. When TorchDevice is active and redirecting to MPS, `torch.compile` (Dynamo) attempts to call `torch.cuda.get_rng_state()`, which in turn calls `torch.cuda.current_device()`, leading to an attempt to access `torch._C._cuda_getDevice()`. TorchDevice reports CUDA as available but does not seem to provide a mock or proper redirection for `_cuda_getDevice` in the context of `torch.compile`, causing the attribute error.
- **Diagnostic Info:** Traceback points to `torch.cuda.random.get_rng_state` -> `torch.cuda.current_device` -> `torch._C._cuda_getDevice()`.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate and fix TorchDevice's handling of `torch.compile` for CUDA-specific functions like `get_rng_state` and `current_device` when redirecting to MPS. A mock or appropriate redirection for `_cuda_getDevice` might be needed.
  - This is a separate issue from the DeBERTa JIT compilation error.
- **Test run command:** `python -m unittest TD_tests/utils/test_deprecation.py`

### `TD_tests/utils/test_file_utils.py`

- **Date Tested:** 2025-06-08
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Component:** PyTorch JIT Compilation / TorchDevice Wrapper (`*args, **kwargs`) / DeBERTa Model Import
- **Error:**

  ```text
  RuntimeError: Failed to import transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta because of the following error (look up to see its traceback):
  Compiled functions can't take variable number of arguments or use keyword-only arguments with defaults:
    File "/Users/mps/projects/AI-PROJECTS/TorchDevice.worktrees/20250506-rollback/TorchDevice/core/patch.py", line 28
      @functools.wraps(func)
      def wrapped_func(*args, **kwargs):
                               ~~~~~~~ <--- HERE
  ```

- **Suspected Cause / Notes:**
  - The test file uses `from transformers import *`, which attempts to import all modules, including `transformers.models.deberta.modeling_deberta`.
  - The DeBERTa model (or a component it uses) likely employs `torch.jit.script` or `torch.jit.trace`.
  - The PyTorch JIT compiler fails when it encounters a function wrapped by TorchDevice (specifically, a core patch wrapper in `TorchDevice/core/patch.py`) that uses `*args, **kwargs`. JIT has limitations with such function signatures.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate how to make TorchDevice's core wrappers more JIT-compatible, possibly by avoiding `**kwargs` where JIT is sensitive or by providing JIT-specific alternative wrappers.
  - Consider if utility tests truly need `from transformers import *` or if they can use more targeted imports.
- **Test run command:** `ACTIVATE_TORCH_DEVICE=1 python -m unittest -v tests.utils.test_file_utils`
