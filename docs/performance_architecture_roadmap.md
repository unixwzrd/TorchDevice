# Performance Architecture Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the planned performance improvements for TorchDevice, focusing on reducing overhead, optimizing device routing, and implementing intelligent fallback mechanisms.

## Current Performance Issues

1. **Excessive CPU Fallback**: Current bypass patches move tensors to CPU for all RNN operations, causing significant performance loss
2. **Return Type Inconsistency**: Some operations return tuples instead of expected objects (e.g., PackedSequence)
3. **No Operation Caching**: Repeated attempts to run operations that fail on target devices
4. **Inefficient Device Routing**: No intelligent routing based on operation capabilities

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Smart Patching Implementation

**Goal**: Reduce patching overhead by 90%

- **Selective Patch Application**: Only patch operations when actually needed
- **Early Exit Mechanisms**: Skip device redirection for tensors already on correct device
- **Device Capability Matrix**: Cache which operations work on which devices
- **Direct Passthrough**: Bypass patching for device-agnostic operations

### 2. Robust Device Fallback System ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Intelligent fallback with minimal performance impact

#### **Core Principles:**
- **Try target device first** - don't assume operations will fail
- **Fall back only on specific errors** - not general errors
- **Cache operation capabilities** - remember what works where
- **Maintain return type consistency** - same type regardless of fallback path

#### **Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Operation Capability Detection**
   - Test operations on target device first
   - Cache results to avoid repeated attempts
   - Distinguish between device compatibility errors vs. general errors

2. **Intelligent Fallback Routing**
   - CUDA → MPS → MLX → CPU hierarchy
   - Only fall back when specific device compatibility errors occur
   - Maintain proper return types across all fallback paths

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Avoid unnecessary CPU moves
   - Cache successful operation paths
   - Provide clear error messages when fallback is not possible

4. **Return Type Consistency**
   - Ensure PackedSequence always returns PackedSequence (not tuple)
   - Handle all return types properly in fallback scenarios
   - Maintain API compatibility regardless of fallback path

#### **Example Implementation:**
```python
def intelligent_fallback(operation, *args, **kwargs):
    # Try target device first
    try:
        return operation(*args, **kwargs)
    except DeviceCompatibilityError as e:
        # Cache this operation as incompatible with target device
        cache_operation_failure(operation, target_device)
        
        # Fall back to CPU with proper return type handling
        return cpu_fallback_with_type_preservation(operation, *args, **kwargs)
    except Exception as e:
        # General error - don't fall back, let it propagate
        raise
```

### 3. MLX Integration

**Goal**: Add MLX as a high-performance fallback option

- **MLX Availability Detection**: Check for MLX support
- **CUDA→MLX Fallback**: Route CUDA operations to MLX when available
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage MLX's performance characteristics

### 4. Performance Benchmarking

**Goal**: Measure and track performance improvements

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Real-world workload testing
- **Automated Regression Testing**: Catch performance regressions
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks
- **Target**: 15-25% improvement in real-world workloads

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Current)

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 15-25% improvement in real-world workloads
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% operation success rate with proper fallback
3. **Overhead**: 90% reduction in patching overhead
4. **Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility across all fallback paths
