# TorchDevice Master Roadmap
*Unified Implementation & Performance Strategy - 2025-07-10*

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document unifies the performance architecture roadmap with our current implementation status to create a clear, actionable path forward. We have a solid foundation (4,269 functions analyzed) but need to implement the core functionality before optimizing performance.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We Have (Solid Foundation)
- **4,269 PyTorch functions** analyzed and cataloged with status tracking
- **120 MLX functions** extracted for cross-mapping
- **126 functions** with MLX equivalents identified (3.0% coverage)
- **Comprehensive migration plan** with implementation phases
- **Performance architecture roadmap** with optimization strategies
- **Clean documentation structure** - no more confusion

### 🔴 Critical Gaps (URGENT)
- **0 functions implemented** (100% not started)
- **No core device translation** - CUDA→MPS mapping missing
- **No intelligent fallback system** - all operations fail or fall back to CPU
- **No performance optimization** - excessive CPU fallback causing performance loss

## 🚀 Unified Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 0: Foundation Implementation (URGENT - Start Today)**
**Goal**: Implement core device translation functionality

#### 0.1 Core Device Functions (158 functions - CRITICAL)
- `torch.device()` - Device object creation and translation
- `torch.tensor()` - Tensor creation with device parameter translation
- `torch.zeros()`, `torch.ones()`, `torch.empty()` - Basic tensor creation
- `torch.set_default_device()` - Default device management

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
def translate_device(device):
    """Core device translation function"""
    if device.type == 'cuda':
        return torch.device('mps')  # Translate to MPS
    return device

def intercept_device_creation(device_arg):
    """Intercept torch.device() calls"""
    actual_device = translate_device(device_arg)
    return actual_device
```

#### 0.2 Device Management (4 functions)
- Events and streams management
- CUDA→MPS translation for async operations

#### 0.3 Basic Fallback System
- Simple CPU fallback for unsupported operations
- Basic error handling and logging

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 10 core functions implemented and tested
- [ ] Basic CUDA→MPS translation working
- [ ] Unit tests passing for core functions
- [ ] Simple CPU fallback for unsupported operations

### **Phase 1: Intelligent Fallback System (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Goal**: Implement robust device fallback with minimal performance impact

#### 1.1 Operation Capability Detection
- Test operations on target device first
- Cache results to avoid repeated attempts
- Distinguish between device compatibility errors vs. general errors

#### 1.2 Intelligent Fallback Routing
- CUDA → MPS → MLX → CPU hierarchy
- Only fall back when specific device compatibility errors occur
- Maintain proper return types across all fallback paths

#### 1.3 Return Type Consistency
- Ensure PackedSequence always returns PackedSequence (not tuple)
- Handle all return types properly in fallback scenarios
- Maintain API compatibility regardless of fallback path

**Implementation Example:**
```python
def intelligent_fallback(operation, *args, **kwargs):
    # Try target device first
    try:
        return operation(*args, **kwargs)
    except DeviceCompatibilityError as e:
        # Cache this operation as incompatible with target device
        cache_operation_failure(operation, target_device)
        
        # Fall back to CPU with proper return type handling
        return cpu_fallback_with_type_preservation(operation, *args, **kwargs)
    except Exception as e:
        # General error - don't fall back, let it propagate
        raise
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 50 functions implemented with intelligent fallback
- [ ] Operation capability caching working
- [ ] Return type consistency maintained
- [ ] Performance within 15% of native MPS

### **Phase 2: Performance Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Goal**: Reduce patching overhead by 90%

#### 2.1 Smart Patching Implementation
- **Selective Patch Application**: Only patch operations when actually needed
- **Early Exit Mechanisms**: Skip device redirection for tensors already on correct device
- **Device Capability Matrix**: Cache which operations work on which devices
- **Direct Passthrough**: Bypass patching for device-agnostic operations

#### 2.2 MLX Integration
- **MLX Availability Detection**: Check for MLX support
- **CUDA→MLX Fallback**: Route CUDA operations to MLX when available
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage MLX's performance characteristics

#### 2.3 Advanced Caching
- Cache successful operation paths
- Cache device capability matrix
- Cache translation mappings

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 200 functions implemented with smart patching
- [ ] 90% reduction in patching overhead
- [ ] MLX integration working
- [ ] Performance within 10% of native MPS

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (LOWER PRIORITY)**
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring

#### 3.1 Performance Benchmarking
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Real-world workload testing
- **Automated Regression Testing**: Catch performance regressions
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks
- **Target**: 15-25% improvement in real-world workloads

#### 3.2 Advanced Monitoring
- Performance monitoring tools
- Dynamic device allocation
- Advanced caching mechanisms

#### 3.3 Complete Implementation
- All 4,269 functions implemented
- Full MLX cross-mapping coverage
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] 99.9% operation success rate
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
