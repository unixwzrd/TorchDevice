# TorchDevice Project TODO List

## Logger Improvements

- **Simplify the Frame Inspection Logic**
  - Review the current implementation of `get_caller_info()`
  - Identify opportunities for simplification
  - Implement a more direct approach to find the caller frame

- **Implement Caching for Performance**
  - Identify functions that are called frequently with the same arguments
  - Add caching for these functions (e.g., using functools.lru_cache)
  - Measure the performance impact of these changes

- **Use Context Managers for Temporary State**
  - Identify operations that temporarily modify state
  - Implement context managers for these operations
  - Ensure proper cleanup even in case of exceptions
