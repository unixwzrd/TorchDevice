# TorchDevice Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The TorchDevice library is currently implemented as a single large file (TorchDevice.py) with approximately 1289 lines of code. This makes it difficult to maintain, extend, and test. The goal of this refactoring is to break down the codebase into smaller, more manageable modules while preserving all functionality.

## Proposed Structure

```
TorchDevice/
├── __init__.py            # Main entry point, imports and initializes TorchDevice
├── core.py                # Core TorchDevice class

├── utils.py               # Utility functions
├── cuda/

│   ├── mocks.py           # CUDA mock implementations

    └── operations.py      # Module operation replacements
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Package Structure and Core Modules

1. **Create Package Structure** - Create the directory structure and empty files
2. **Implement Logging Module** - Move logging functions to logging.py
3. **Implement Utils Module** - Move utility functions to utils.py
4. **Implement Core Module** - Create the basic structure of the core TorchDevice class

### Phase 2: Implement Device-Specific Modules

5. **Implement Events Module** - Move event implementations to cuda/events.py and mps/events.py
6. **Implement Streams Module** - Move stream implementations to cuda/streams.py and mps/streams.py
7. **Implement CUDA Mocks Module** - Move CUDA mock implementations to cuda/mocks.py
8. **Implement MPS Mocks Module** - Move MPS mock implementations to mps/mocks.py

### Phase 3: Implement Operation Modules

9. **Implement Tensor Operations Module** - Move tensor operations to tensor/operations.py
10. **Implement Module Operations Module** - Move module operations to module/operations.py

### Phase 4: Testing and Finalization

11. **Update Package Initialization** - Finalize __init__.py to properly initialize TorchDevice
12. **Run Tests** - Test the refactored code to ensure functionality is preserved
13. **Documentation** - Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Implementation Details

### 1. Logging Module

The logging module will contain:
- Log level constants
- Log verbosity settings
- Functions for getting caller information
- Functions for logging messages at different levels
- Functions for setting verbosity and log file

See [logging_module_implementation.md](logging_module_implementation.md) for details.

### 2. Events and Streams Modules

The events and streams modules will contain:
- MPSEvent class for CUDA event compatibility on MPS
- MPSStream class for CUDA stream compatibility on MPS
- Functions for creating and managing events and streams
- Context managers for stream operations

See [events_streams_implementation.md](events_streams_implementation.md) for details.

### 3. Tensor Operations Module

The tensor operations module will contain:
- Replacements for tensor.cuda() method
- Replacements for tensor.to() method
- Replacements for tensor.mps() method (if it exists)
- Functions for patching and restoring tensor methods

See [tensor_operations_implementation.md](tensor_operations_implementation.md) for details.

### 4. Module Operations Module

The module operations module will contain:
- Replacements for module.cuda() method
- Replacements for module.to() method
- Replacements for module.mps() method (if it exists)
- Functions for patching and restoring module methods

See [module_operations_implementation.md](module_operations_implementation.md) for details.

### 5. Core Module

The core module will contain:
- The main TorchDevice class
- Initialization and patching functions
- Device detection and configuration
- Integration of all other modules

See [initial_package_implementation.md](initial_package_implementation.md) for details.

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Logging Module** - This is used by all other modules, so it should be implemented first
2. **Utils Module** - This provides utility functions used by other modules
3. **Events and Streams Modules** - These are critical for compatibility with PyTorch's dynamo module
4. **Tensor and Module Operations Modules** - These handle the core functionality of redirecting device operations
5. **CUDA and MPS Mocks Modules** - These provide the mock implementations for CUDA and MPS functions
6. **Core Module** - This ties everything together and provides the main interface

## Testing Strategy

After each module is implemented, we should run the tests to ensure that the functionality is preserved:

```bash
cd TorchDevice
tests/run_tests_and_install.py
```

We should also create unit tests for each module to ensure that they work correctly in isolation.

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Improved Code Organization** - Code is organized into logical modules
- **Better Maintainability** - Smaller files are easier to maintain
- **Easier to Extend** - New features can be added to specific modules
- **Improved Testing** - Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Clearer Responsibilities** - Each module has a clear responsibility
- **Better Documentation** - Each module can be documented separately
